Hello. World.  I am an econ major at Sonoma State University, halfway through my senior year.  I've learned Excel, a bit of Stata, and a bit more R during classes at SSU.  I'm now exploring Python as an environment to do econometrics, data analysis, and some other thing I have an interest in (meteorology, oceanography, celestial navigation).  Also taking the opportunity to explore modern workflows and development environments.

**A python 3.6 notebook** after some frustration trying to upgrade 'seaborn' to version
0.9.0, whiched added the relplot() function.
